    <span>Fathers, like mothers, are pillars in the development of a child’s emotional well-being. Children look to their fathers to lay down the rules 
        and enforce them. They also look to their fathers to provide a feeling of security, both physical and emotional. Children want to make their
         fathers proud, and an involved father promotes inner growth and strength. Studies have shown that when fathers are affectionate and supportive, 
        it greatly affects a child’s cognitive and social development. It also instills an overall sense of well-being and self confidence.</span>
